# Face Recognition in Colab Notebook

## Overview

This repository provides a notebook and an implementing face recognition using Python, OpenCV, and the face_recognition library in Google Colab. Whether you are new to face recognition or looking to experiment with facial recognition algorithms, this repository serves as a practical guide.

## Key Features 

- **Upload Known and Unknown Faces:** Easily upload images of known faces for training and unknown faces for recognition directly in Google Colab.
  
- **Face Recognition Functions:** Implement face recognition functions to identify known faces in unknown images, showcasing the capabilities of the face_recognition library.

- **Save and Load Known Faces Data:** Save and load trained face data, enabling efficient reuse of recognition models.

- **Main Function for Camera Testing:** A main function that utilizes the Colab notebook's capabilities for webcam testing and real-time face recognition.

## Usage

1. **Upload Known Faces:** Upload images of individuals you want the model to recognize into the "known_faces" folder.

2. **Upload Unknown Faces:** Upload images containing unknown faces into the "unknown_faces" folder.

3. **Run the Notebook:** Execute the provided notebook in Google Colab, and observe face recognition results in real-time using the webcam.

Explore, experiment, and enhance your understanding of face recognition techniques with this Colab notebook repository.
